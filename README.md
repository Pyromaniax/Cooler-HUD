I always thought that [COOL HUD](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26080) had such a great design that, with some tinkering, it could be a genuine evolution of TF2's default HUD. So, after some years of the author being inactive, I took it upon myself to fix, update, and improve this gorgeous UI. Now, I present to you: Cooler HUD!

Many of the old HUD's problems have been dealt with, including issues caused by recent game updates, overlapping elements, and lag on animations. I also made many modifications of my own, such as closed captions support, TF2-themed materials, fonts and SourceScheme, fixes to old broken UI, a more compact and symmetrical layout, and many more.

I've included files to restore some of the original looks as add-ons, plus the originals and new ones as well. So go nuts—customize it to your heart's burning desire!
